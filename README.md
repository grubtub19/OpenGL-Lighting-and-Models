# OpenGL Lighting and Models

# Description

This is the final project for my Graphics class. It uses OpenGL (using JOGL) to create a 3D environment with Models imported from .obj files that are lit using the Blinn-Phong shading model. I also implemented omnidirectional shadow mapping.

The camera is controlled with mouse and keyboard (wasdqe). The lamp can be moved too (up, down, left, right, <, >).

Many of the models are custom posed in Blender. A select few have their texture maps edited with my professors face.
